            <p class="football__text"> A goalkeeper is a player whose
                duty it is to defend his goal , that is, to prevent the opposing team from scoring a goal . There are
                usually special rules that only apply to goalkeepers. Goalkeepers often wear additional equipment. In
                football, the goalkeeper may touch the ball with his hands within his own penalty area . The
                goalkeeper's uniform must be different from that of the other players on the team, as well as the
                opponents and referees. The goalkeeper wears special gloves to cushion the blows and allow him to better
                grip the ball. A goalkeeper who leaves the penalty area is considered a regular player.</p>

            <p class="hockey__text">In ice hockey, the goalkeeper wears special equipment consisting of a reinforced
                carapace, helmet, shin guards, a trap, a pancake and a special stick . The goalkeeper can push the puck
                to the ice or trap it to stop play by holding the puck for three seconds. Attacking the goalkeeper is
                considered a violation.
                Unlike goalkeepers in other sports, a goaltender in English ice hockey is not usually called a
                goalkeeper, but a goaltender or goalie.</p>
